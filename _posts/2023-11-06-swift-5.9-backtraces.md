title: On-Crash Backtraces in Swift
author: [al45tair]
---

The new Swift 5.9 release contains a number of exciting features to
help you debug your code, including an out-of-process interactive
crash handler to inspect crashes in real time, the ability to trigger
the debugger for just-in-time debugging, along with concurrency-aware
backtracing to make it easier to understand control flow in a program
that uses Swift Concurrency.

### Handling a crash

Previously, all you would get when your program fails is a message
from the parent process (often the shell) telling you that the child
process crashed:

<pre class="terminal" style='color:#fff; background: #000'>
<span class='shell'>$ </span><span class='cmd'>./crash</span>
I&#39m;m going to crash now
zsh: segmentation fault  ./crash
</pre>

On Apple platforms or on Windows, you could look at the crash logs
captured by the operating system's built-in crash reporter, but on
Linux that's typically all you had to go on.

Now, however, instead of the opaque message above, when run from a
terminal the result is now something like this:

<pre class="terminal" style='color:#fff; background: #000'>
<span class='shell'>$ </span><span class='cmd'>./crash</span>
I&#39;m going to crash now

💣 <span style='color:#f55'>Program crashed: Bad pointer dereference at 0x0000000000000004</span>

If you run the same program but within a pipeline (so, not attached to
a terminal), you'll instead see a report like this:

```

```

This new feature is active by default on Linux, but must be manually
enabled on macOS.  It is not supported presently on Windows, or on
non-macOS Apple platforms.

### Interactive backtraces

You might be wondering about the message on the last line of the
in-terminal backtrace above, where it says:

```
Press space to interact, D to debug, or any other key to quit (30s)
```

Often when developing a program at the terminal, you might find that
the program crashes, but you aren't able to reproduce the problem.
Without a suitable crash log, that can be very annoying --- you know
your program has a bug, but you don't know what it was or how to
reproduce it.

The idea behind this feature is that it leaves the program suspended
(by default for 30 seconds, but this is configurable) and provides you
with the opportunity to either attach a debugger, or perform some
limited additional inspection of the crashed process.

If you tap the spacebar when this prompt appears, you will be
presented with a simple command prompt that allows you to change the
backtracer settings, generate a new backtrace, list loaded images,
display register and memory contents and get a listing of all of the
threads in the process.  Typing `help` at the prompt will bring up a
list of available commands:

<pre class="terminal" style="color:#fff; background:#000">
<span style='color:#555'>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>help
Available commands:

backtrace  Display a backtrace.
bt         Synonym for backtrace.
debug      Attach the debugger.
exit       Exit interaction, allowing program to crash normally.
help       Display help.
images     List images loaded by the program.
mem        Synonym for memory.
memory     Inspect memory.
process    Show information about the process.
quit       Synonym for exit.
reg        Synonym for registers.
registers  Display the registers.
set        Set or show options.
thread     Show or set the current thread.
threads    Synonym for process.
</pre>

If you use the `debug` command or press `D` at the prompt, the
backtracer will help you to attach a debugger to your program.
Exactly what happens here is platform-dependent.

If you press any other key, or if the 30 second timer runs down, the
program will be allowed to crash normally.

By default, the interactive feature will trigger if your program's
standard input and output are both attached to a terminal; in many
cases this means that you'll get the right behaviour automatically if
you're running in a CI system or as part of some automated script,
because those tend to run with the program's output redirected to a
pipe or to a file.

In situations where you do not want this feature enabled, you can
explicitly disable it by setting the environment variable
`SWIFT_BACKTRACE` to `interactive=no` or, to also disable colored
output, `interactive=no,color=no`.

### Swift Concurrency support

The backtracer is concurrency-aware and will correctly step back
through asynchronous frames.  For example, given the program:

```swift
func level(n: Int) async {
  if n < 5 {
    await level(n: n + 1)
  } else {
    let ptr = UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>(bitPattern: 4)!
    ptr.pointee = 42
  }
}

@main
struct CrashAsync {
  static func main() async {
    await level(n: 1)
  }
}
```

the backtrace will look like:

<pre class="terminal" style="color:#fff; background:#000">
<span class='shell'>$ </span><span class='cmd'>./crashAsync</span>

💣 <span style='color:#f55'>Program crashed: Bad pointer dereference at 0x0000000000000004</span>

On Apple platforms, this feature has no special requirements, but for
other platforms the backtracer needs to be able to look up symbols
to determine whether or not a given frame is asynchronous.  If the
necessary symbols are not available, the backtrace will follow the
normal program stack rather than the async activation chain.  This
will usually result in it showing frames from the Concurrency runtime,
which are unlikely to be helpful when debugging most types of problem.

### Making backtraces more readable

You can configure the maximum number of frames that the backtracer
will generate (the default is 64), but since you might also want to
see frames at the top of the stack, the backtracer also has a setting
for the number of frames to capture there (by default 16).  This is
particularly handy if your program crashes due to excessive recursion,
as you'll usually see both the recursion and the cause of it, without
being overwhelmed by thousands and thousands of frames.

The backtracer also skips over system frames and Swift thunks by
default.  These are usually not relevant except to compiler or runtime
engineers, and generally result in more confusing output for most
developers.

Additionally, the backtracer will automatically demangle both Swift
and C++ mangled names.

### Summary

We've added configurable on-crash backtracing to Swift to help you
debug your programs when they misbehave.  The new backtracer has a
number of helpful features including:

* Support for Swift Concurrency.
* Smart, in-line display of program source, where available.
* Support for C++ name mangling in addition to Swift.
* Colorized output to make backtraces easier to read.
* The option to pause and inspect your crashed program, or even
  trigger the debugger for just-in-time debugging.
* Configurable output ([see
documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/Backtracing.rst)).

The new feature is enabled by default on Linux and can be enabled when
required for macOS ([see
documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/Backtracing.rst)).
There is no Windows support at present.
